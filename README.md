Odin Project recipe website

This project was created to test and demonstrate my HTML skills. 

In this project, I utilized a boilerplate template to start each html file, and used my knowledge of creating links to other pages to point to a few different food recipes.

Each page contains an embedded image, as well as demonstrates the usage of lists (both ordered and unordered).
